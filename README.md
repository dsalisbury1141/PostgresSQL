# SQL-Challenge

This assignment was interesting and I was easily able to get through the 8 solutions within PGAdmin. 
I struggled with the bonus I really wanted to solve and create the  2 visualizations but finally was learned how to import the querys and create some visualizations.  
I tried my best to provide what was needed in this bonus and got as close as possible to the 2 plots neeeded for the extra credit.. I added a couple more plots since I worked on this for an extra week it wans't till 1 day ago I learned how to import the queries and not only the DB..  This was a great learning experiance.
