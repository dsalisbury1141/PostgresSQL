# SQL-Challenge

This assignment was interesting and I was easily able to get through the 8 solutions within PGAdmin. 
I struggled with the bonus I really wanted to solve and create the  2 visualizations but fell short. I was able to import the DB from SQL that was a win, I was also able to product at least one DataFrame. but fell short after that. I will continue to chip away at this one and homefully learn how to complete this one.
